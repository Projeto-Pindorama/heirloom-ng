.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I install
command copies one regular file to a destination file
or one or more regular files into a destination directory.
It is commonly used within Makefiles
to install newly created software components.
.PP
If the
.B \-d
option is present,
.I install
creates the named
.IR directory ,
also creating non-existent parent directories.
It is not an error if the directory already exists.
The
.BR \-g ,
.BR \-m ,
and
.B \-o
options
apply to the last pathname component only;
attributes are set whether the directory is newly created or not.
Parent directories are always created using a default mode of 777
minus umask
and default ownerships.

The following options are also accepted:
