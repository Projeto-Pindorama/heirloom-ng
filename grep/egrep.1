.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B egrep
command searches the lines of the specified files
(or of standard input)
for occurrences of
.I pattern.
The default behavior is to print each matching line to standard output.
.PP
The
.B /usr/5bin/egrep
command accepts full regular expressions;
it uses a deterministic algorithm with moderate space requirements.
.PP
The
.B /usr/5bin/posix/egrep
command accepts extended regular expressions.
It uses a deterministic algorithm with moderate space requirements
unless the expression includes multi-character collating elements,
which cause the use of a nondeterministic algorithm.
.PP
.B /usr/5bin/s42/egrep
and
.B /usr/5bin/posix2001/egrep
are identical to
.BR /usr/5bin/posix/egrep .
.SS "Full Regular Expressions"
.PP
In the following description `character' excludes
newline:
.IP 1.
A \fB\e\fR followed by a single character
matches that character.
.IP 2.
The character \fB^\fR
(\fB$\fR) matches the beginning (end) of a line
as an \fIanchor\fR.
.IP 3.
A 
.B .\&
matches any character.
.IP 4.
A single character not otherwise endowed with special
meaning matches that character.
.IP 5.
A string enclosed in brackets \fB[\|]\fR
forms a \fIbracket expression\fR that
matches any single character from the string.
Ranges of ASCII character codes may be abbreviated
as in `\fIa\fB\-\fIz0\fB\-\fI9\fR'.
A ]
may occur only as the first character of the string.
A literal \- must be placed where it can't be
mistaken as a range indicator.
.IP 6.
A regular expression followed by \fB*\fR (\fB+\fR, \fB?\fR) matches a sequence
of 0 or more (1 or more, 0 or 1)
matches of the regular expression.
.IP 7.
Two regular expressions concatenated
match a match of the first followed by a match of 
the second.
.IP 8.
Two regular expressions separated by \fB|\fR or newline
match either a match for the first or a match for the
second (\fIalternation\fR).
.IP 9.
A regular expression enclosed in parentheses \fB(\|)\fR
matches a match for the regular expression (\fIgrouping\fR).
.LP
The order of precedence of operators
is [\|] then (\|) then
*+? then concatenation then | and newline.
.SS "Extended Regular Expressions"
Extended Regular Expressions add the following features
to Full Regular Expressions:
.IP 10.
A regular expression
followed by \fB{\fIm\fB,\fIn\fB}\fR
forms an \fIinterval expression\fR that
matches a sequence of \fIm\fR through \fIn\fR matches, inclusive,
of the regular expression.
The values of \fIm\fR and \fIn\fR must be non-negative
and smaller than 255.
The form \fB{\fIm\fB}\fR matches exactly \fIm\fR occurrences,
\fB{\fIm\fB,}\fR matches at least \fIm\fR occurrences.
.IP 11.
In bracket expressions as described in 5.,
the following character sequences are considered special:
.IP
Character class expressions of the form
\fB[:\fIclass\fB:]\fR.
In the C LC_CTYPE locale,
the classes
.sp
.TS
l l l l.
[:alnum:]	[:cntrl:]	[:lower:]	[:space:]
[:alpha:]	[:digit:]	[:print:]	[:upper:]
[:blank:]	[:graph:]	[:punct:]	[:xdigit:]
.TE
.sp
are recognized;
further locale-specific classes may be available.
A character class expression matches any character
that belongs to the given class in the current LC_CTYPE locale.
.IP
Collating symbol expressions of the form
\fB[.\fIc\fB.]\fR,
where \fIc\fR is a collating symbol
in the current LC_COLLATE locale.
A collating symbol expression
matches the specified collating symbol.
.IP
Equivalence class expressions of the form
\fB[=\fIc\fB=]\fR,
where \fIc\fR is a collating symbol
in the current LC_COLLATE locale.
An equivalence class expression
matches any character that has the same collating weight
as \fIc\fR.
.LP
The order of precedence of operators
is [=\|=] [:\|:] [.\|.]
then [\|]
then (\|)
then *+? {m,n}
then concatenation
then ^ $
then | and newline.
.PP
Care should be taken when using the characters
$ * [ ^ | ? \' " ( ) and \e in the expression
as they are also meaningful to the Shell.
It is safest to enclose the entire expression
argument in single quotes \' \'.
.PP
Both
.B /usr/5bin/egrep
and
.B /usr/5bin/posix/egrep
accept the following options:
.TP
.B \-b
Each line is preceded by the block number on which it was found.
This is sometimes useful
in locating disk block numbers by context.
Block numbers start with 0.
.TP
.B \-c
Only a count of matching lines is printed.
.TP
.BI \-e\  pattern_list
Specifies one or more patterns, separated by newline characters.
A line is selected if one or more of the specified patterns are found.
.TP
.BI \-f\  pattern_file
One or more patterns, separated by newline
characters, are read from
.I pattern_file.
If multiple
.B \-e
or
.B \-f
options are supplied to
.BR /usr/5bin/posix/egrep ,
all of the pattern lists will be evaluated.
.TP
.B \-h
Normally, the name of each input file is printed before a match
if there is more that one input file.
When this option is present, no file names are printed.
.TP
.B \-i
Upper- and lowercase differences are ignored when searching matches.
.TP
.B \-l
The names of files with matching lines are listed
(once) separated by newlines.
.TP
.B \-n
Each line is preceded by its line number in the file.
Line numbers start with 1.
.TP
.B \-v
All lines but those matching are printed.
.PP
The following options are supported by
.B /usr/5bin/posix/egrep
only:
.TP
.B \-q
Do not write anything to standard output.
.TP
.B \-s
Error messages for nonexistent or unreadable files are suppressed.
.TP
.B \-x
Consider only lines consisting of the pattern as a whole,
like a regular expression surrounded by
.I ^
and
.I $.
.PP
The following options are supported as extensions:
.TP
.B \-r
With this option given,
.I egrep
does not directly search in each given file that is a directory,
but descends it recursively
and scans each regular file found below it.
Device files are ignored.
Symbolic links are followed.
.TP
.B \-R
Operates recursively as with the
.I \-r
option,
but does not follow symbolic links that point to directories
unless if they are explicitly specified as arguments.
.TP
.B \-z
If an input file is found to be compressed with
.IR compress (1),
.IR gzip (1),
or
.IR bzip2 (1),
the appropriate compression program is started,
and
.I egrep
searches for the pattern in its output.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.TP
.BR LANG ", " LC_ALL
See
.IR locale (7).
.TP
.B LC_COLLATE
Affects the collation order for range expressions,
equivalence classes, and collation symbols
in extended regular expressions.
.TP
.B LC_CTYPE
Determines the mapping of bytes to characters
in both full and extended regular expressions,
the availability and composition of character classes
in extended regular expressions,
and the case mapping for the
.B \-i
option.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
ed(1),
fgrep(1),
grep(1),
sed(1),
locale(7)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Exit status is 0 if any matches are found,
1 if none, 2 for syntax errors or inaccessible files.
.SH NOTES
If a line contains a
.SM NUL
character,
only matches up to this character are found with
.BR /usr/5bin/posix/egrep .
The entire matching line will be printed.
.PP
The LC_COLLATE variable has currently no effect.
Ranges in bracket expressions are ordered
as byte values in single-byte locales
and as wide character values in multibyte locales;
equivalence classes match the given character only,
and multi-character collating elements are not available.
.PP
For portable programs, restrict textual data
to the US-ASCII character set,
set the LC_CTYPE and LC_COLLATE variables to `C' or `POSIX',
and use the constructs in the second column
instead of the character class expressions as follows:
.RS 
.sp
.TS
l l.
[[:alnum:]]	[0\-9A\-Za\-z]
[[:alpha:]]	[A\-Za\-z]
[[:blank:]]	[\fI<tab><space>\fR]
[[:cntrl:]]	[^\fI<space>\fR\-~]
[[:digit:]]	[0\-9]
[[:graph:]]	[!\-~]
[[:lower:]]	[a\-z]
[[:print:]]	[\fI<space>\fR\-~]
[[:punct:]]	[!\-/:\-@[\-`{\-~]
[[:space:]]	[\fI<tab><vt><ff><cr><space>\fR]
[[:upper:]]	[A\-Z]
[[:xdigit:]]	[0\-9a\-fA\-F]
.TE
.sp
.RE
.IR <tab> ,
.IR <space> ,
.IR <vt> ,
.IR <ff> ,
and
.I <cr>
indicate inclusion of
a literal tabulator, space, vertical tabulator, formfeed,
or carriage return character, respectively.
Do not put the
.IR <vt> ,
.IR <ff> ,
and
.I <cr>
characters into the range expression for the
.I space
class unless you actually want to match these characters.
.PP
Interval expressions were newly introduced
with extended regular expressions
and cannot be used in portable programs.
To put a literal
.RB ` { '
character into an expression,
use
.IR [{] .
