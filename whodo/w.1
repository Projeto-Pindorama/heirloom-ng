.SH DESCRIPTION
W prints a summary of the current activity on the system,
including what each user is doing.
The heading line shows
the current time of day,
how long the system has been up,
the number of users logged into the system,
and the load averages.
The load average numbers give
the number of jobs in the run queue averaged over 1, 5 and 15 minutes.

The fields output are:

the name of the tty the user is on,

the CPU time used by all processes and their children on that terminal,
the CPU time used by the currently active processes,
the name and arguments of the current process.
