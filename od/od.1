.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Od
dumps
.I file
in
one or more formats
as
selected by the option arguments.
If no format specification is present,
.B \-o
is default.
The meanings of the option arguments are:
.TP
.B  \-b
Interpret bytes in octal.
.TP
.B  \-c
Interpret characters.
Certain non-graphic characters appear as C escapes:
null=\e0,
backspace=\eb,
formfeed=\ef,
newline=\en,
return=\er,
tab=\et;
others appear as 3-digit octal numbers.
For a multibyte character,
the graphical representation is printed for its first byte,
remaining bytes are marked
.BR ** .
.TP
.B  \-d
Interpret unsigned two-byte words in decimal.
.TP
.B \-D
Interpret unsigned four-byte words in decimal.
.TP
.B \-f
Interpret floating point format as single precision.
.TP
.B \-F
Interpret floating point format as double precision.
.TP
.B  \-o
Interpret two-byte words in octal.
.TP
.B \-O
Interpret four-byte words in octal.
.TP
.B  \-s
Interpret signed two-byte words in decimal.
.TP
.B \-S
Interpret signed four-byte words in decimal.
.TP
.B \-v
Print identical groups of output lines
that immediately follow each other
instead of abbreviating
all but the first one by printing a single
.B *
character.
.TP
.B  \-x
Interpret two-byte words in hexadecimal.
.TP
.B  \-X
Interpret four-byte words in hexadecimal.
.PP
The following option is supported as an extension:
.TP
.B \-C
Prints the input data interpreted as characters
as another column right next to the regular output.
Non-printable characters are replaced by periods.
.PP
The
.I file
argument specifies which file is to be dumped.
If no file argument is specified,
the standard input is used.
If more than one file argument is specified,
the concatenation of all files
without an intervening separator
is dumped.
.PP
The offset argument specifies the offset
in the file where dumping is to commence.
This argument is normally interpreted
as octal bytes.
If `\fB.\fR' is appended, the offset is interpreted in
decimal.
If `\fBb\fR' is appended, the offset is interpreted in
blocks of 512 bytes.
If the file argument is omitted,
the offset argument must be preceded by
.RB ` + '
with
.BR /usr/5bin/posix/od .
.PP
The following options have been introduced by POSIX.2.
If any of these options is present,
an offset-like argument
is always interpreted as the name of a file to be dumped.
.TP
\fB\-A \fIaddress_base\fR
Sets the format of the file offset printed in the first column.
Valid values for \fIaddress_base\fR are:
.RS
.TP 3
.B d
Print offset as decimal.
.TP 3
.B n
Print no offset column.
.TP 3
.B o
Print offset as octal (default).
.TP 3
.B x
Print offset as hexadecimal.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-j \fIskip\fR
Skip
.I skip
bytes of input,
where
.I skip
may be either a decimal number,
an octal number preceded by
.BR 0 ,
or a hexadecimal number preceded by
.B 0x
or
.BR 0X .
If the last character of
.I skip
is
.B b
(if not a hexadecimal number),
.BR k ,
or
.BR m ,
the value is multiplied by
512, 1024, or 1048576, respectively.
.TP
\fB\-N \fIcount\fR
Terminate processing after
.I count
bytes of input,
where
.I count
may be either a decimal number,
an octal number preceded by
.BR 0 ,
or a hexadecimal number preceded by
.B 0x
or
.BR 0X .
.TP
\fB\-t \fItype_string\fR
Set output format.
\fItype_string\fR may consist of one or more specifications as follows:
.RS
.TP
\fBa\fR
Print characters,
ignoring the most significant bit.
ASCII control characters are printed as their names,
other nonprintable characters are printed as octal bytes.
.TP
\fBc\fR
Print characters.
Non-printable characters are either printed as escape sequences
`\e0', `\ea', `\eb', `\ef', `\en', `\er', `\et', `\ev'
or as octal bytes.
For a multibyte character,
the graphical representation is printed for its first byte,
remaining bytes are marked
.BR ** .
.TP
\fBd\fR[\fB1\fR|\fB2\fR|\fB4\fR|\fB8\fR|\fBC\fR|\fBS\fR|\fBI\fR|\fBL\fR]
Print signed decimal words,
with the word length indicated by the second character
(\fB1\fR one byte per word,
\fB2\fR two bytes per word,
\fB4\fR four bytes per word,
\fB8\fR eight bytes per word,
\fBC\fR the size of the C language `char' data type,
\fBS\fR the size of the C language `short' data type,
\fBI\fR the size of the C language `int' data type,
and \fBL\fR the size of the C language `long' data type).
The default is the machine word length.
.TP
\fBf\fR[\fB4\fR|\fB8\fR|\fBF\fR|\fBD\fR|\fBL\fR]
Print floating point format,
with the precision indicated by the second character
(\fB4\fR and \fBF\fR single precision,
\fB8\fR, \fBD\fR, and \fBL\fR double precision).
The default is double precision.
.TP
\fBo\fR[\fB1\fR|\fB2\fR|\fB4\fR|\fB8\fR|\fBC\fR|\fBS\fR|\fBI\fR|\fBL\fR]
Print octal words,
with the word length indicated by the second character
as described for
.B d
above.
.TP
\fBu\fR[\fB1\fR|\fB2\fR|\fB4\fR|\fB8\fR|\fBC\fR|\fBS\fR|\fBI\fR|\fBL\fR]
Print unsigned decimal words,
with the word length indicated by the second character
as described for
.B d
above.
.TP
\fBx\fR[\fB1\fR|\fB2\fR|\fB4\fR|\fB8\fR|\fBC\fR|\fBS\fR|\fBI\fR|\fBL\fR]
Print hexadecimal words,
with the word length indicated by the second character
as described for
.B d
above.
.RE
.PP
Unless the
.B \-N
option is given,
dumping continues until end-of-file.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"

Determines the mapping of bytes to characters
for the

and
.B \-tc
options.
