.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBcat\fR [\fB\-suv\fR [\fB\-et\fR]] [\fB\-B\ \fIsize\fR] [\fIfile\fR ...]

.B Cat
reads each file in sequence and writes it
on the standard output. Thus

prints the file and
.RS
.sp

concatenates the first two files and places the result
on the third.

With this option given,
non-printable characters are detected
and printed as `\fB^\fIn\fR' for control characters
and `\fBM\-\fIn\fR' for characters with the high bit set.
.TP
.B \-t
If
.B \-v
is present,
this option causes tab and formfeed characters
to be handled as control characters.
