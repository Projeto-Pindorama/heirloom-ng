.TH DEROFF 1 "9/22/06" "Heirloom Toolchest" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
deroff \- remove nroff/troff, tbl, and eqn constructs
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBderoff\fR [\fB\-m\fIx\fR] [\fB\-w\fR] [\fB\-x\fIN\fR] [ \fIfiles\fR ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Deroff
reads each file in sequence
and removes all
.I nroff
and
.IR troff (1)
requests and non-text arguments, backslash constructions,
and constructs of preprocessors such as
.IR eqn (1),
.IR pic (1),
and
.IR tbl (1).
Remaining text is written on the standard output.
.I Deroff
follows files included by
\&.so
and
\&.nx
commands;
if a file has already been included, a
\&.so
for that file is ignored and a
\&.nx
terminates execution.
If no input file is given,
.I deroff
reads from standard input.
.PP
The options are
.TP
.B \-w
Output a word list, one `word' (string of letters, digits, and
properly embedded ampersands and apostrophes,
beginning with a letter) per line.
Other characters are skipped.
Otherwise, the output follows the original, with the deletions mentioned above.
.\".TP
.\".B \-_
.\"Like
.\".BR \-w ,
.\"but consider underscores to be alphanumeric rather than punctuation.
.TP
.B \-i
Ignore
\&.so
and
\&.nx
equests.
.TP
.BR \-ms
.PD 0
.TP
.B \-mm
Remove titles, attachments, etc., as well as ordinary
.IR troff
constructs, from
.IR ms (7)
or
.IR mm (7)
documents.
.PD
.TP
.B \-ml
Same as
.BR \-mm ,
but remove lists as well.
.TP
.BI \-x N
Set the extension level to \fIN\fR
(cf. the \fIHeirloom nroff/troff User's Manual).
.I deroff
also sets the extension level
when it encounters the \fB.do\fR and \fB.xflag\fR commands,
so use of this option will often be unnecessary.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
troff(1),
spell(1)
.SH NOTES
.B Deroff
is not a complete troff
interpreter, so it can be confused by subtle constructs.
Most errors result in too much rather than too little output.
