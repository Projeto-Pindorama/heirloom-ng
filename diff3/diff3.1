.SH NAME
diff3 \- 3-way differential file comparison
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdiff3\fR [\fB\-exEX3\fR] \fIfile1 file2 file3\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Diff3
compares three versions of a file,
and publishes disagreeing ranges of text
flagged with these codes:
.TP 16
====
all three files differ
.TP 16
====1
.IR file1 " is different"
.TP 16
====2
.IR file2 " is different"
.TP 16
====3
.IR file3 " is different"
.PP
The type of change suffered in converting a given range
of a given file to some other is
indicated in one of these ways:
.TP 16
.IB f " : " n1 " a"
Text is to be appended after line number
.I n1
in file
.I f,
where
.I f
= 1, 2, or 3.
.TP 16
.IB f " : " n1 " , " n2 " c"
Text is to be
changed in the range line
.I n1
to line
.IR n2 .
If 
.I n1
=
.I n2,
the range may be abbreviated to
.IR n1 .
.PP
The original contents of the range follows immediately
after a
.B c
indication.
When the contents of two
files are identical, the contents of the lower-numbered
file is suppressed.
.PP
Under the
.B \-e
option,
.I diff3
publishes a script for the editor
.I ed
that will incorporate into
.I file1
all changes between
.I file2
and
.I file3,
.IR i.e .
the changes that normally would be flagged ==== and ====3.
Option
.B \-x
(\fB\-3\fR)
produces a script to incorporate
only changes flagged ==== (====3).
The following command will apply the resulting script to
`file1'.
.PP
.ti 16n
(cat script; echo \'1,$p\') \(bv ed \- file1
.PP
The
.B \-E
and
.B \-X
are similar to
.B \-e
and
.BR \-x ,
respectively, but treat overlapping changes (i.e., changes that would
be flagged with ==== in the normal listing) differently.  The overlapping
lines from both files will be inserted by the edit script, bracketed
by "<<<<<<" and ">>>>>>" lines.
.PP
For example, suppose lines 7-8 are changed in both file1 and file2.
Applying the edit script generated by the command
.ce
"diff3 -E file1 file2 file3" 
.br
to file1 results in the file:
.RS
.nf

lines 1-6
of file1
<<<<<<< file1
lines 7-8
of file1
=======
lines 7-8
of file3
>>>>>>> file3
rest of file1
.fi
.RE
.\".PP
.\"The
.\".B \-E
.\"option is used by RCS
.\".IR merge (1)
.\"to insure that overlapping changes in the merged files are preserved
.\"and brought to someone's attention.

.SH NOTES
Text lines that consist of a single `.' will
defeat
.B \-e.
