.SH NAME
mv \- move or rename files and directories
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmv\fR [\fB\-f\fR] [\fB\-i\fR] [\fB\-b\ \fIsize\fR]
\fIfile1\fR [\fIfile2\fR .\ .\ .\ ] \fItarget\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Mv
moves (changes the name of)
.I file1
to
.IR target .
If
.I target
is an existing regular file,
its content is overwritten.
Its mode and owner are preserved;
the mode of the source file is used otherwise.
If
the mode of
.I target
forbids writing
(and standard input is terminal for
.B /usr/5bin/mv
and
.BR /usr/5bin/s42/mv ),
.B mv
prints the mode
(see
.IR chmod (2))
and reads the standard input
to obtain a line;
if the line begins with y,
the move takes place;
if not,
the file is not moved.
.PP
If
.I target
is a directory,
one or more files are copied
into the directory with their original file-names.
.PP
.B Mv
refuses to move a file onto itself.
.PP
The
.B mv
command accepts the following options:
.TP
.B \-f
.B Mv
will not ask for confirmation
even if the modes of the
.I target
file do not permit writing.
Overrides the
.B \-i
option in
.B /usr/5bin/posix/mv
and
.BR /usr/5bin/posix2001/mv .
.TP
.B \-i
.B mv
will ask for confirmation
before overwriting an existing target.
For
.B /usr/5bin/mv
and
.BR /usr/5bin/s42/mv ,
this flag will be automatically disabled
if standard input is not a terminal.
Overrides the
.B \-f
option in
.B /usr/5bin/posix/mv
and
.BR /usr/5bin/posix2001/mv .
.PP
The following option is an extension:
.TP
\fB\-b\ \fIsize\fR
When a regular file is moved to another file system,
its data must be copied.
This option overrides the automatically determined
i/o buffer size for such copies;
.I size
is given in bytes.

.SH NOTES
Use either
.RS
.sp
.B mv
.B \-\-
.I \-file
.I target
.sp
.RE
or
.RS
.sp
.B mv
.I ./\-file
.I target
.sp
.RE
to move files that begin with a hyphen character.
.PP
If source and target
lie on different file systems,
.B mv
must copy the file and delete the original.
In this case
any linking relationship with other files is lost,
but
.B mv
will preserve linkage inside the moved tree.
.B Mv
will try to preserve access and modification times,
user and group ownerships,
and file permission bits.
Failing to preserve these modes
is not considered an error,
only
.B /usr/5bin/posix/mv
and
.B /usr/5bin/posix2001/mv
will print an error message.
Special files
such as block and character devices,
FIFOs,
and symbolic links
are recreated in the target hierarchy.
.PP
The pathname contained in a symbolic link
is not changed when the link is moved.
Symbolic links with relative pathnames
may thus change or lose their target
if moved to a different level in the file hierarchy.
