.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B who
command,
without an argument,
lists the login name,
terminal name,
and login time
for each current user.
.PP
Without an argument,
.B who
examines the
.B /var/run/utmp
file to obtain its information.
If a
.I utmp_file
is given,
that file is examined.
Typically the given file will be
.BR /var/log/wtmp ,
which contains a record
of all the logins since it was created.
Then
.B who
lists logins, logouts and crashes
since the creation of the wtmp file.
Each login is listed with user name,
terminal name (with `\fB/dev/\fR' suppressed),
and date and time.
.PP
With the two-argument synopsis forms
`\fBwho am i\fR' and `\fBwho am I\fR',
who tells who you are logged in as.
.PP
The
.B who
command accepts the following options:
.TP
.B \-a
Same as \fB\-bdlprtTu\fR.
.TP
.B \-b
Writes reboot records.
.TP
.B \-d
Writes records about dead processes
along with their termination and exit values.
.TP
.B \-H
Causes column headings to be printed in the first line.
.TP
.B \-l
Writes records about lines
on which the system is waiting for someone to login.
.TP
.B \-m
Outputs only records about the current terminal,
as `\fBwho am I\fR' does.
.TP
\fB\-n\fI number\fR
Sets the number of columns for the
.B \-q
option.
.TP
.B \-p
Lists records about other processes currently active
that have been spawned by
.BR init .
.TP
.B \-q
Quick output format.
For each login record,
the user name is printed.
All other options are ignored.
.TP
.B \-R
Adds the host name field to the output.
.TP
.B \-r
Writes the current run-level of the
.B init
process.
.TP
.B \-s
Omits idle time and
login process ID (default).
.TP
.B \-t
Writes records concerning system time changes.
.TP
.B \-T
Shows write access to the user's terminal (see
.IR mesg (1):
`\fB+\fR' if writing is permitted,
`\fB-\fR' if writing is denied, and
`\fB?\fR' if the status cannot be determined.
For
.B /usr/5bin/who
and
.BR /usr/5bin/s42/who ,
.B \-u
is implied.
.TP
.B \-u
Adds idle time
(the time since the last keypress on the terminal)
and login process ID to the output.
A terminal that has not been accessed for 24 hours
is considered `\fBold\fR';
a terminal that has been accessed within the last minute
is marked with a dot `\fB.\fR'.
