.SH NAME
pathchk \- check pathnames
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpathchk\fR [\fB\-p\fR] \fIname\fR ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I pathchk
command verifies the validity or portability of path names.
For each
.I name
given, it is checked
that each of the intermediate directories is searchable
or could be created,
that none of its components is longer than NAME_MAX,
and that the whole
.I name
is not longer than PATH_MAX.
.PP
With the
.B \-p
option, the checks are performed using
_POSIX_NAME_MAX and _POSIX_PATH_MAX,
and each character of a component of
.I name
must be in the portable character set
(i.\|e. alphanumerics, dot `.', underscore `_', and minus sign `\-').
The check for local searchability is omitted.
.PP
If any violation of these rules is detected,
.I pathchk
prints an error message and exits with failure.
