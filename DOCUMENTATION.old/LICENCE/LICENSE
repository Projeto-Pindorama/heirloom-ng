The inflate decompression code for the zip support has been derived from

      2. Redistributions in binary form (compiled executables) must
	 reproduce the above copyright notice, definition, disclaimer,
	 and this list of conditions in documentation and/or other
	 materials provided with the distribution.  The sole exception

	 binary as part of a self-extracting archive; that is permitted
	 without inclusion of this license, as long as the normal
	 UnZipSFX banner has not been removed from the binary or
	 disabled.

      3. Altered versions--including, but not limited to, ports to new
	 operating systems, existing ports with new graphical
	 interfaces, and dynamic, shared, or static library
	 versions--must be plainly marked as such and must not be
	 misrepresented as being the original source.  Such altered
	 versions also must not be misrepresented as being Info-ZIP
	 releases--including, but not limited to, labeling of the
	 altered versions with the names "Info-ZIP" (or any variation
	 thereof, including, but not limited to, different
	 capitalizations), "Pocket UnZip," "WiZ" or "MacZip" without
	 the explicit permission of Info-ZIP.  Such altered versions
	 are further prohibited from misrepresentative use of the
	 Zip-Bugs or Info-ZIP e-mail addresses or of the Info-ZIP
	 URL(s).

      4. Info-ZIP retains the right to use the names "Info-ZIP," "Zip,"
	 "UnZip," "UnZipSFX," "WiZ," "Pocket UnZip," "Pocket Zip," and
	 "MacZip" for its own source and binary releases.

The unshrink decompression code is derived from Info-ZIP's unzip 5.40:

     * Copyright (c) 1994 Greg Roelofs.
     * Permission is granted to any individual/institution/corporate
     * entity to use, copy, redistribute or modify this software for
     * any purpose whatsoever, subject to the conditions noted in the
     * Frequently Asked Questions section below, plus one additional
     * condition:  namely, that my name not be removed from the source
     * code.  (Other names may, of course, be added as modifications
     * are made.)  Corporate legal staff (like at IBM :-) ) who have
     * problems understanding this can contact me through Zip-Bugs...


   Q. Can I use the source code of Zip and UnZip in my commercial
      application?

   A. Yes, so long as you include in your product an acknowledgment; a
      pointer to the original, free compression sources; and a statement
      making it clear that there are no extra or hidden charges resulting
      from the use of our compression code in your product (see below for
      an example).  The acknowledgment should appear in at least one piece
      of human-readable documentation (e.g., a README file or man page),
      although additionally putting it in the executable(s) is OK, too.
      In other words, you are allowed to sell only your own work, not ours,
      and we'd like a little credit.  (Note the additional restrictions
      above on the code in unreduce.c, unshrink.c, vms.c, time_lib.c, and
      everything in the wince and windll subdirectories.)  Contact us at
      Zip-Bugs@lists.wku.edu if you have special requirements.  We also
      like to hear when our code is being used, but we don't require that.

         <Product> incorporates compression code from the Info-ZIP group.
         There are no extra charges or costs due to the use of this code,
         and the original compression sources are freely available from
         http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/ or ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/
         on the Internet.

      If you only need compression capability, not full zipfile support,
      you might want to look at zlib instead; it has fewer restrictions
      on commercial use.  See http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib/ .

The blast decompression code (for DCL imploded zip archive entries) was
derived from code by Mark Adler distributed with zlib 1.2.1:
