.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B touch
utility
changes the access and modification times of files.
It creates a file if it does not already exist.
If none of the arguments specify the time to set,
the current time is used.
.PP
If neither the
.B \-r
nor the
.B \-t
option is used to specify a time value
and the first non-option argument begins with a digit,
and it consists of exactly eight or ten digits with
.B /usr/5bin/posix/touch
and
.BR /usr/5bin/posix2001/touch ,
the times of the files are set to the given time.
.PP
The meaning of fields in time specifications is as follows:
.RS
.PP
\fICC\fP	The first two digits of the year.
.br
\fIYY\fP	The second two digits of the year.
.br
\fIMM\fP	The month of the year (01-12).
.br
\fIDD\fP	The day of the month (01-31).
.br
\fIhh\fP	The hour of the day (00-23).

is in the range of 69\^\(en\^99,
or 20 for
.I YY
values of 00\^\(en\^68.

.B /usr/5bin/posix/touch
and
.BR /usr/5bin/posix2001/touch .
.TP

but not the modification time unless
