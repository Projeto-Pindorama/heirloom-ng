.TH SEQ 1 "06/03/23" "Heirloom Toolchest" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
seq \- print a sequence of numbers
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBseq\fR [\fB\-w\fR] [\fB\-ppicture\fR] [\fB\-sseparator\fR] [\fBstart\fR [\fBstep\fR]] stop
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B seq
utility prints a sequence of numbers, one per line
or separated per a character defined by the user, from
the \fBstart\fR (which is defaulted to 1) as near as
possible to \fBstop\fR, in steps of \fBstep\fR.
.br
It works in a similar spirit than a
.B for()
loop, present in the C, Go and
.B ksh93(1)
programming languages, and also
.B range()
in Python.
.PP
It accepts the following options:
.TP
.B \-w
Sets the number of decimal places as a constant width
per padding short numbers with leading decimal zeroes.
It gets annulled if combined with \-p.
.TP
.B \-p \fIpicture\fR
Defines the number of decimal places to be printed 
after the decimal separator per using another number
as a \fIpicture\fR.
The default is full precision (see "%g" at \fBprintf(3)\fR).
.TP
.B \-s \fIseparator\fR
Defines a character to be the separator between the
numbers being printed. The default is a line break ("\\n").
.SH EXAMPLES
The
.B seq
utility may be used as one of the ways to calculate a
termial (\fIn?\fR) in a quick way using
.Xr bc 1
in a
.Xr sh 1
pipeline.
.IP \& 2
.BI "example% seq -s'+' 4 | bc"
.LP
.SH NOTES
.PP
If you need to count from a negative number
to a positive one, you will need to do this
maneuver below, at least for now:
.IP \& 2
.BI "example% seq -s' ' -- -5 10" 
.LP
.br
.PP
It does not implement the \-w option
neither \-f found in Plan 9 from Bell
Labs' implementation, although \-p can
replace \-f in some cases.
.SH BUGS
Maybe?
.SH "SEE ALSO"
printf(3)
.SH HISTORY
A
.B seq
command first appeared in AT&T
Research Unix 8th edition.
.br
This version has its payloads
based off Plan 9 from Bell Labs,
1th Ed. and GNU shell utilities 1.13
implementation, but only part of the
standard was implemented.
