When
.I persons
are named,
.I mail
takes the standard input up to an end-of-file (or a line with just `.')
and adds it to each
.I person's
`mail' file.  The message is preceded by the sender's name and a postmark.
Lines that look like postmarks are prepended with `>'.  A
.I person
is either a user name recognized by
.IR  login (1),
an internet address (see
.IR mailaddr (7),
or a recipient on a UUCP remote system, with the login name prefixed 
by the system name and exclamation mark (see
.IR uucp (1C)).
.PP
The
.B \-e
option checks for the existence of mail only
and causes
.B mail
to exit successfully if mail is present.
.PP
The
.B \-f
option causes the named file, for example, `mbox',
to be printed as if it were the mail file.
.PP
When invoked with the
.B \-h
option,
.I mail
will display a header summary when starting
and will then prompt for commands.
.PP
With
\fB\-m\ \fImessage_type\fR,
a `Message-Type:' header field with the given value
.I message_type
is created.
This field is solely for informational purposes
and has no technical meaning in the Internet mail system.
.PP
The
.B \-p
option causes all messages to be printed
without prompting for disposition.
.PP
With the
.B \-P
option given,
all header fields are printed by default.
.PP
An interrupt normally terminates the 
.I mail
command; the mail file is unchanged.
The
.B \-q
option tells
.I mail
to continue after interrupts.
.PP
The
.B \-r
option displays the mail messages in first-in, first-out order.
.PP
The
.B \-t
option causes a `To:' header field to be created
with the names of all recipients.
.PP
With the
.B \-w
option,
.I mail
does not wait until the mail transfer agent finishes execution
when a message is sent.
.PP
When a user logs in he is informed of the presence of mail.

.SH NOTES

.PP
The
.I mail
command is restricted to text messages in the current locale.
It does not support the MIME specification.
For message exchange on the Internet,
.I mail
is thus effectively restricted to ASCII text messages.
