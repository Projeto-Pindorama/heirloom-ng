 *  NAME
 *	cksaved - check for an orphaned save file
 *
 *  SYNOPSIS
 *	void cksaved(char *user)
 *
 *  DESCRIPTION
 *	cksaved() looks to see if there is a saved-mail file sitting
 *	around which should be reinstated. These files should be sitting
 *	around only in the case of a crash during rewriting a mail message.
 *
 *	The strategy is simple: if the file exists it is appended to
 *	the end of $MAIL.  It is better that a user potentially sees the
 *	mail twice than to lose it.
 *
 *	If $MAIL doesn't exist, then a simple rename() will suffice.
