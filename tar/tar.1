.SH NAME
tar \- tape archiver
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtar\fR [\ \fIkey\fR\ ] [\ \fIfiles\fR\ ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Tar
saves and restores files
on magtape or other media.
Its actions are controlled by the
.I key
argument.
The
.I key
is a string of characters containing
at most one function letter and possibly
one or more function modifiers.
Other arguments to the command are file or directory
names specifying which files are to be dumped or restored.
In all cases, appearance of a directory name refers to
the files and (recursively) subdirectories of that directory.
.PP
The function portion of
the key is specified by one of the following letters;
use of the leading hyphen is optional:
.TP 8
.B  \-r
The named files
are written
on the end of the tape.
The
.B \-c
function implies this.
.TP 8
.B  \-x
The named files are extracted from the tape.
If the named file matches a directory whose contents 
had been written onto the tape, this directory is (recursively) extracted.
The owner and mode are restored (if possible).
If no file argument is given, the entire content of the
tape is extracted.
Note that if multiple entries specifying the same file
are on the tape, the last one overwrites
all earlier.
Existing target files are removed
before the file in the archive is extracted.
.TP 8
.B  \-t
The names of the specified files are listed each time they occur
on the tape.
If no file argument is given,
all of the names on the tape are listed.
.TP 8
.B  \-u
The named files are added to the tape if either they
are not already there or have
been modified since last put on the tape.
.TP 8
.B  \-c
Create a new tape; writing begins on the beginning
of the tape instead of after the last file.
This command implies
.B \-r.
.PP
The following characters may be used in addition to the letter
which selects the function desired.
.TP 10
.BI 0 \&...\& 9
This
modifier selects the drive on which the tape (or other media) is mounted.
Each number selects an `archive\fIN\fR=' entry in
.IR /etc/default/tar ,
which is followed by up to four fields:
device name,
blocking factor,
size in kilobytes,
and tape flag (`n' or `N' for no tape).
The entry `archive=' is the default
if neither this modifier nor the
.B f
key is given
and the
.I TAPE
environment variable is not present.
The following example sets up a tape,
a 1.44 MB floppy drive
for use with `0', using a blocking factor of 18,
and a 1.2 MB floppy drive for use with `1',
using a blocking factor of 15:
.sp
    archive=/dev/rmt/c0s0     20    0
.br
    archive0=/dev/dsk/f03ht   18    1440   N
.br
    archive1=/dev/dsk/f15ht   15    1200   N
.TP 10
.B  v
Normally
.I tar
does its work silently.
The
.B v
(verbose)
option causes it to type the name of each file it treats
preceded by the function letter.
With the
.B t
function,
.B v
gives more information about the
tape entries than just the name.
.TP 10
.B  w
causes
.I tar
to print the action to be taken followed by file name, then
wait for user confirmation. If a word beginning with `y'
is given, the action is performed. Any other input means
don't do it.
.TP 10
.B f
causes 
.I tar
to use the next argument as the name of the archive instead
of the default (see the description for the `0\&...\&9' key above).
If the name of the file is `\-', tar writes to
standard output or reads from standard input, whichever is
appropriate. Thus,
.I tar
can be used as the head or tail of a filter chain.
.I Tar
can also be used to move hierarchies with the command
.sp
    cd fromdir; tar cf \- . | (cd todir; tar xfp \-)
.TP 10
.B b
causes
.I tar
to use the next argument as the blocking factor for tape
records. The default is device dependent.
This option should only be used with raw magnetic tape archives (See
.B f
above).
.TP 10
.B l
tells
.I tar
to complain if it cannot resolve all of the links
to the files dumped. If this is not specified, no
error messages are printed.
.TP 10
.B o
causes
.I tar
to set the owner and group of restored files
to those of the invoking user
instead of those specified in the archive.
This is the default
unless the caller is the super-user.
.TP 10
.B p
causes
.I tar
to set the permission bits of extracted files
exactly to those given in the archive;
normally, the current
.I umask
is applied.
.TP 10
.B i
tells
.I tar
not to exit when a directory checksum error is encountered.
.TP 10
.B e
tells
.I tar
to exit at several minor error conditions
that normally cause only a warning.
.TP 10
.B n
tells
.I tar
that the input file is not a tape.
This causes block sizes to be
reported in kilobytes instead of tape blocks with the `v' modifier.
.TP 10
.B m
causes
.I tar
not to restore modification times on extracted files;
the modification time is the time when the file was restored.
.TP 10
.B h
causes
.I tar
to store the target of a symbolic link in the archive
and to follow symbolic links to directories
instead of storing the link itself.
.TP 10
.B L
Same as
.BR h .
.TP 10
.B A
causes
.I tar
to strip a leading `/' when storing and restoring pathnames,
i.\|e. to store and extract relative names instead of absolute ones.
.TP 10
.B k
can be used to create and extract multi-volume archives.
The next unevaluated argument is used as the maximum size in kilobytes
for each part.
If the archive does not fit on one medium,
the user is prompted for the next.
The same sizes must be given for creation and extraction
of multi-volume archives.
.TP 10
.B B
causes
.I tar
to repeat a
.IR read (2)
operation if it gets fewer data than expected.
This is useful when reading from pipes, network transports etc.,
and is enabled per default if reading from standard input,
pipes, or sockets.
.TP 10
.B F
specifies the name of a file with additional pathnames
in the next unevaluated argument.
Each line of this file must contain a pathname
(without any leading or trailing white-space)
that is put into the archive
before further files specified on the command line.
.TP 10
.B X
specifies the name of a file
that contains pathnames to be excluded,
in the same format as with
.BR F .
This option may be specified multiple times,
causing pathnames contained in any of the files
to be excluded.
.PP
.I Tar
also accepts the following options
intermixed with the file
.IR names :
.TP 10
\fB\-C\fI dir\fR
Change the working directory to
.I dir
before archiving the file
.I name
immediately following
.IR dir ;
.I name
is interpreted relative to
.IR dir .
.TP 10
\fB\-I\fI file\fR
Specifies a file with additional pathnames
as described for the
.B F
key above,
inserted at the current position in the archive.
.PP
The archive format written by
.I tar
is expected to be compatible
with the `Extended tar Format' as defined in
IEEE Std. 1003.1, 1996,
although the numerical
.I uid
and
.I gid
fields are always used for extraction,
ignoring the symbolic
.I uname
and
.I gname
fields.
.PP
IEEE Std. 1003.1, 2001
.I pax
format extended headers are created by
.I tar
under the following circumstances:
A path name exceeds 255 bytes
or does not contain a slash character at an appropriate position,
and does not contain non-UTF-8 characters;
the name of a linked file exceeds 100 bytes;
a file is larger than 8\ GB;
a user or group ID exceeds the number 2097151.
When updating GNU or old format archives,
no extended headers are created
and any path names are limited to 100 bytes.
Most GNU extensions are supported when reading archives,
and Sun extensions also for appending.
.PP
Multi-volume archives are splitted single-volume archives.
For an archive created with
.sp
    tar cfk /dev/dsk/f03ht 1440 \fIinput\fR
.sp
it is thus possible to generate a single-volume archive by executing
.sp
    dd if=/dev/dsk/f03ht bs=1k count=1440 >>singlevolume
.sp
once for each floppy disk.
.PP
On archives compressed with
.IR bzip2 (1),
.IR compress (1),
or
.IR gzip (1),
the appropriate decompression program is run automatically
with the
.I t
and
.I x
keys.
.PP
The following keys are supported as extensions:
.TP 10
.B z
causes
.I tar
to pipe its output through
.IR gzip (1)
when creating archives.
When reading archives,
this option is ignored.
.TP 10
.B j
Similar to
.IR z ,
but using
.IR bzip2 (1)
as compression program.
.TP 10
.B Z
Similar to
.IR z ,
but using
.IR compress (1)
as compression program.
.SH EXAMPLES
List the contents of a software distribution archive:
.in +2
.sp
tar tvf distribution.tar.gz
.in -2
.PP
Extract a software distribution archive,
preserving file permissions,
but setting the owner of all extracted files
to the invoking user
(even if invoked by
.IR root ):
.in +2
.sp
tar xfop distribution.tar.gz
.in -2
.PP
Write the current directory to the default archive location:
.in +2
.sp
tar c .
.sp
.in -2
If the default location is a floppy drive,
the archive is split across multiple volumes if necessary.
.PP
Create a
.IR gzip (1)
compressed archive of the directory
.I project
and its contents:
.in +2
.sp
tar cf \- project | gzip \-c > project.tar.gz
.in -2
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.TP 10
.BR LANG ", " LC_ALL
See
.IR locale (7).
.TP 10
.B LC_TIME
Used for the time string printed with when the keys
.B tv
are given.
.TP 10
.B SYSV3
If set,
old tar format archives are created with `c',
and the meaning of the `e' key is changed
such that archiving is aborted
if a file cannot fit on a single volume
of a multi-volume archive.
.TP 10
.B TAPE
Used as default archive
if neither the `f' nor the `0\&...\&9' keys are present.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Complaints about bad key characters and tape read/write errors.
.PP
Complaints if enough memory is not available to hold
the link tables.
.SH NOTES
There is no way to ask for the
.IR n -th
occurrence of a file.
.PP
Tape errors are handled ungracefully.
.PP
The
.B u
option can be slow.
.PP
Use of the
.B r
and
.B u
options with tape devices requires
drives capable of writing between filemarks.
