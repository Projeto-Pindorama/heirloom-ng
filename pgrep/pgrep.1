.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pgrep
searches the currently active processes
for occurences of the specified
.I pattern
and prints the process IDs of the matching ones.
.I Pattern
is treated as an extended regular expression
as described in
.IR egrep (1).
A number of options can be used in addition to the
.I pattern
(or without specifying
.IR pattern )
to further restrict the set of matching processes.
Multiple criteria can be specified for each of these options,
separated by commas or blanks,
or by giving the option more than once.
In this case,
all processes that match any of the given criteria
are considered matches.
If more than one kind of criterion is specified,
a process must match each kind of criterion.
.PP
.I Pkill
is similar to
.IR pgrep ,
but a signal (SIGTERM by default)
is sent to matching processes
instead of printing its process ID.
The signal can be changed with the
\fB\-\fIsignal\fR
argument;
this argument must appear before all options
to be recognized.
.I Signal
can be either numeric
or symbolic with the SIG prefix omitted
(as in QUIT for SIGQUIT).
.PP
Zombie processes and the current
.I pgrep
or
.I pkill
process are never included.
.PP
Both commands accept the following options:
.TP 12
\fB\-d \fIdelim\fR
Use the specified
.I delimiter
string to separate process IDs in output.
By default, a newline character is used.
This option is accepted by
.I pgrep
only.
.TP 12
.B \-f
Use the command line arguments of each process
instead of the name of its executable file
for matching,
and, if
.B \-l
is also specified,
for printing.
.TP 12
\fB\-g\fI pgrplist\fR
Restrict matches to processes
whose process group ID
appears in
.IR pgrplist .
If an ID is `0',
the process group ID of the current process is used.
.TP 12
\fB\-G\fI gidlist\fR
Restrict matches to processes
whose real group ID
appears in
.IR gidlist .
.TP 12
.B \-l
Print the command name in addition to the process ID.
This option is accepted by
.I pgrep
only.
.TP 12
.B \-n
Select only the newest (most recently created) process
of all processes that matched the other criteria.
Cannot be combined with
.IR \-o .
.TP 12
.B \-o
Select only the oldest (least recently created) process
of all processes that matched the other criteria.
Cannot be combined with
.IR \-n .
.TP 12
\fB\-P\fI ppidlist\fR
Restrict matches to processes
whose parent ID appears in
.IR ppidlist .
.TP 12
\fB\-s\fI sidlist\fR
Restrict matches to processes
that are members of a session given in
.IR sidlist .
If an ID is `0',
the session ID of the current process is used.
.TP 12
\fB\-t\fI termlist\fR
Restrict matches to processes
that run on any controlling terminal given in
.IR termlist .
Terminal specifications have the format described in
.IR ps (1).
.TP 12
\fB\-u\fI uidlist\fR
Restrict matches to processes
whose effective user ID
appears in
.IR uidlist .
.TP 12
\fB\-U\fI uidlist\fR
Restrict matches to processes
whose real user ID
appears in
.IR uidlist .
.TP 12
.B \-v
Reverse the match,
that is,
select all processes that fail to fulfill the given criteria.
.TP 12
.B \-x
Require the entire process name to be matched,
as if
.I pattern
was surrounded by `^( )$'.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Determine the process ID of the
.I inetd
process:
.RS
.sp
pgrep \-x inetd
.sp
.RE
Print all processes that have a first argument starting with
.I /bin/
along with their arguments:
.RS
.sp
pgrep \-l \-f \'^/bin/\'
.sp
.RE
Send a SIGHUP signal to all processes that are owned by either the
.I root
or the
.I daemon
user and are children of the
.I init
process
(process ID 1):
.RS
.sp
pkill \-HUP \-u root,daemon \-P 1
.sp
.RE
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.TP
.BR LANG ", " LC_ALL
See
.IR locale (7).
.TP
.B LC_COLLATE
Affects the collation order for range expressions,
equivalence classes, and collation symbols
in extended regular expressions.
.TP
.B LC_CTYPE
Determines the mapping of bytes to characters and
the availability and composition of character classes
in extended regular expressions.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.I Pgrep
and
.I Pkill
exit with
.TP
0
if matching processes were found,
and the \fI\-v\fR option was not specified;
.br
.ns
.TP
1
if no matching processes were found,
or the \fI\-v\fR option was specified without any matches;
.br
.ns
.TP
2
if an invalid command line argument was found;
.br
.ns
.TP
3
on fatal errors.
.SH NOTES
Command names are limited to 18 characters,
process arguments to 80 characters;
excess characters are stripped.
