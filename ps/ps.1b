.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Ps
prints certain indicia about active processes.
If no options are specified,
all processes on the current terminal
that are owned by the invoking user
and are not session leaders
are selected.
Specifying
.B \-a
selects other users' processes;
specifying
.B \-x
selects processes without controlling terminals.
The selection can further be changed
by adding
.I criteria
with the options below;
when a process satifies any criterion,
it is selected.
A
.I criteria
string can consist
of multiple criteria
separated by blanks or commas.
If the
.I pid
argument is present,
output is restriced to the selected process.
.PP
By default,
.B ps
prints the process id,
controlling terminal device,
process status,
cumulative execution time
and command of processes.
.PP
The
.B ps
command accepts the following options:
.TP 12
.B \-a
Selects all processes with a controlling terminal device
(including session leaders).
.TP 12
.B \-c
Prints the command name,
as stored internally in the system for purposes of accounting,
rather than the command arguments,
which are kept in the process' address space.
This is more reliable, if less informative,
since the process is free to destroy the latter information.
.TP 12
.B \-g
Includes session leaders in the output.
Without this option,
.B ps
only prints ``interesting'' processes.
Processes are deemed to be uninteresting
if they are session leaders.
This normally eliminates top-level command interpreters
and processes waiting for users to login on free terminals.
.TP 12
.B \-l
Long listing;
adds process flags,
numeric user id,
parent process id, cpu usage,
priority, nice value,
memory and resident set size in pages and the event waited for.
See below for the meaning of columns.
.TP 12
.B \-n
For a user listing as selected with
.BR \-u ,
print the numeric user ID instead of the user name.
.TP 12
.B \-r
Causes only running processes to be printed.
.TP 12
.B \-S
Includes the time used by children that have been waited for.
.TP 12
\fB\-t\fI device\fR
Selects all processes with the current terminal
.IR device .
This may be the device name with either
.B /dev/
or
.B /dev/tty
omitted,
as in
.I ttyS2
or
.I S2
for
.IR /dev/ttyS2 .
Giving
.B ?
as a device name selects processes with no controlling terminal.
.TP 12
.B \-u
A user oriented output is produced; adds user name,
processor usage, memory and resident set size,
and the time when the process was started.
.TP 12
.B \-v
A version of the output
containing virtual memory statistics is output;
adds memory and resident set size.
.TP 12
.B \-w
Increase output width.
The default width of 80 columns
is set to 132 if this option is given once;
if given more than once,
the output width is unlimited.
.TP 12
.B \-x
Include processes that have no controlling terminal.
.PP
The following options have been introduced by POSIX.2:
.TP 12
.B \-A
Selects all processes.
.TP 12
\fB\-G\fI gidlist\fR
Selects all processes that have one of the specified real \fIgroup ids\fR,
which may be symbolic or numeric.
.TP 12
\fB\-o\fI property\fR[\fB=\fR[\fItitle\fR]],...
The output is changed to reflect the named
.IR property .
Multiple properties can be given,
separated by blanks or commas;
it is also possible to specify multiple
.B \-o
options.
Normally, the default property description is
written in the first output line.
If the
.B = 
character is present, but the
.I title
is missing in all format specifications,
no descriptions are printed;
if a
.I title
is given, it is used instead of the default.
See below for valid
.I property
strings.
.TP 12
\fB\-p\fI pidlist\fR
Selects all processes with one of the given \fIprocess ids\fR.
.TP 12
\fB\-U\fI uidlist\fR
Selects all processes with one of the given real \fIuser ids\fR,
which may be symbolic or numeric.
