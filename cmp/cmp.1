.SH NAME
cmp \- compare two files
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBcmp\fR [\fB\-l\fR] [\fB\-s\fR] [\fB\-w\fR]
\fIfile1 file2\fR [\fIskip1\fR [\fIskip2\fR]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The two files are
compared.
(If a file is `\-',
the standard input is used.)
Under default options,
.I cmp
makes no comment if the files are the same;
if they differ, it announces the byte and line number
at which the difference occurred.
If one file is an initial subsequence
of the other, that fact is noted.
If
.I skip1
or
.I skip2
are given,
the indicated number of bytes is read from each file
before the comparison starts.
The
.I skip
values may be either decimal or,
if beginning with `0', octal.
.PP
Options:
.TP 6
.B  \-l
Print the byte number (decimal) and the
differing bytes (octal) for each difference.
.TP 6
.B  \-s
Print nothing for differing files;
return codes only.
.PP
The following option is an extension:
.TP 6
.B  \-w
For each difference,
the surrounding 8-byte unit,
measured from the beginning of the file,
is printed for both files
as a 64-bit MSB integer in octal,
and as a byte string,
with non-ASCII and control characters replaced by an underscore.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Exit code 0 is returned for identical
files, 1 for different files, 2 for an
inaccessible or missing argument.
