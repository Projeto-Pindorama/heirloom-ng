.SH NAME
wc \- word count
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBwc\fR [\fB\-c\fR|\fB\-m\fR] [\fB\-lw\fR] [\fIfile\fR ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Wc determines the number of lines, words and characters
contained in each
.I file
and writes the count in that order to standard output,
separated by spaces and followed by the filename.
If no
.I file
argument is given,
standard input is used
and no filename is printed.
If more than one input file was processed successfully,
a grand total for all files is printed in the line of output.
.PP
The
.B wc
command accepts the following options;
if any of them is present,
output is restricted to the specified fields:
.TP
.B \-c
Print the number of bytes.
.TP
.B \-l
Print the number of lines (i.\ e. newline characters).
.TP
.B \-m
Print the number of characters
instead of the number of bytes.
The number of characters equals
the number of bytes in singlebyte locales.
In multibyte locales,
this is the count of byte sequences forming a valid character.
This option was introduced by POSIX.2.
.TP
.B \-w
Print the number of words.
With
.B /usr/5bin/wc
and
.BR /usr/5bin/s42/wc ,
a word is a string of characters
that contains at least one graphical character
and is delimited by blank or newline characters.
With
.B /usr/5bin/posix/wc
and
.BR /usr/5bin/posix2001/wc ,
a word is a nonempty string of characters
that is delimited by white space.
