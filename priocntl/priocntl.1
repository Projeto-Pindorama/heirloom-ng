.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B priocntl
command sets or displays scheduling parameters
for a set of processes.
Every running process is member of a scheduling class.
Standard scheduling classes are:
.IP
The time-sharing class (\fBTS\fR),
which is usually the default.
Processes in this class
are scheduled according to a dynamic priority
based on the adjustable base priority
and fair usage principles.
The base priority used with the
.I priocntl
command is the negative of the
.I nice
value (see
.IR nice (1));
higher base priorities
mean a higher chance that the process is run.
Base priorities range between \-19 and 20.
.IP
The batch class (\fBB\fR),
whose members are given longer timeslices
but can be preempted by any time-sharing process.
.IP
The isochronous class (\fBISO\fR),
whose members retain their dynamic priority
even if they make heavy use of computing resources.
.IP
The real time round-robin (fixed priority) scheduling class
(\fBRT\fR or \fBFP\fR).
Processes that belong to this class
have always a fixed higher priority
than processes in the time-sharing class
and are scheduled according to a priority value (1 to 99).
Each process can run for a maximum time quantum
and is placed at the end of the associated priority list
if the time quantum is exceeded.
.IP
The real time first in-first out scheduling class (\fBFF\fR),
which is similar to the round-robin scheduling class
except that no maximum time quantum is applied.
.PP
The process usually requires privilegue
to get into one of the real time scheduling classes.
If a process tries this but lacks the privilegue,
it will be put into the isochronous class instead.
.PP
See
.IR sched_setscheduler (2)
for further detail on scheduling classes.
.PP
With the
.B \-l
option,
a list of all available scheduling classes
is printed along with the associated parameters for each class.
.PP
The
.B \-d
option causes
the current scheduling parameters for a set of processes
to be printed.
.PP
The
.B \-s
option allows to alter the scheduling parameters
for a set of processes.
To change the parameters of the
.I init
process (process ID 1),
the \fI\-i pid\fR option must be specified
with 1 appearing in
.IR idlist .
.PP
If the
.B \-e
option is used,
.I command
is executed with the given scheduling parameters.
.PP
The
.I idlist
arguments
specify the set of processes to be selected for the
.B \-d
and
.B \-s
options.
They are normally interpreted as process IDs;
the
.B \-i
option can be used to alter their meaning,
according to the following arguments:
.RS
.TP 8
.B pid
.I idlist
is a set of process IDs (the default).
.TP 8
.B ppid
Causes all processes whose parent process has
a process ID present in
.I idlist
to be selected.
.TP 8
.B pgid
Selects all processes that belong to a process group id
present in
.IR idlist .
.TP 8
.B sid
Selects all processes that belong to a session
whose session id is present in
.IR idlist .
.TP 8
.B class
.I idlist
is interpreted as a set of scheduling classes;
all processes that belong to a given class are selected.
.TP 8
.B uid
Selects all processes whose (numeric) effective user ID appears in
.I idlist .
.TP 8
.B gid
Selects all processes whose (numeric) effective group ID appears in
.I idlist .
.TP 8
.B all
Selects all processes currently running.
The
.I idlist
arguments are ignored.
.RE
.PP
If an
.B \-i
option is present but no
.I idlist
is specified,
the process ID, parent process ID etc.
of the
.I priocntl
command itself is used.
.PP
The
.B \-c
option allows to select a scheduling class
for processes with the
.B \-s
and
.B \-e
options
(see above for the explanation of valid classes).
.PP
The class-specific option is currently
\fB\-p\fI priority\fR
for all scheduling classes;
it allows to set the base or scheduling priority
for the process, as described above.

.SH NOTES
Due to the lack of a
.IR priocntl ()
system call on Linux and FreeBSD,
selection of processes is performed in user space,
and there is a time gap between selection
and the operation of parameter setting
with the
.B \-s
option.
For an
.I idlist
of other than a single process id,
it is thus possible that the
.I priocntl
command misses processes that are created
at the time it is running,
without being able to inform the user if this has happened.
.PP
The batch class and the isochronous class
are not available on FreeBSD
and are currently not part of the mainline Linux kernel;
Con Kolivas' patch set adds support for them.
