.SH DESCRIPTION
Df prints file system statistics.
A file system is selected
by a file it contains,
or by its device file,
as specified by the
.I file
argument.
If no
.I file
argument is given,
statistics are printed for all mounted file systems.
The basic size unit is a
.I block
consisting of 512 bytes.
.PP
.B dfspace
prints available and total disk space in megabyte units.
.PP
The
.B df
command accepts the following options:
.TP
.B \-b
Print only the number of kilobytes free.
.TP
.B \-be
Print counts of free kilobytes and available files.
.TP
.B \-e
Print only the number of available files.
.TP
.B \-f
Omit the number of available files
in traditional output format.
.TP
.BI \-F \ fstype
Restrict output to filesystems of type
.I fstype.
.TP
.B \-g
Print the entire
.IR statvfs (2)
structure.
Overrides the \-b, \-e, \-k, \-n, \-P, and \-t options.
.TP
.B \-k
If given alone, the allocation is printed in kbytes,
and a different output format is used.
If combined with the \-P option,
the size unit is changed from blocks to kbytes.
Overrides the \-b, \-e, \-f, \-n, \-t, and \-v options.
.TP
.B \-l
Omit statistics about non-local file systems.
Currently, file systems with types of
.B nfs
and
.B smbfs
are considered to be non-local.
.TP
.B \-n
Print the file system mount point and file system type only.
.TP
.BI \-o \ fsoptions
Specifiy file-system specific options.
There are none so this option will always cause an error message.
.TP
.B \-t
Use the traditional output format as it is the default,
but include total allocated-space figures in the output.
Overrides the \-b, \-e and \-n options.
.TP
.B \-v
Select verbose output format,
that is,
mount point, device;
total, used, and free block counts;
and usage in percent.
.TP
.B \-V
Print command lines for each file system only.
.PP
The following option has been introduced by POSIX.2:
.TP
.B \-P
Select the portable 
.SM (POSIX)
output format.
.PP
The following options are extensions:
.TP
.B \-h
Prints the sizes in human-readable powers of 1024,
i.\|e. `K' for kilobyte,
`M' for megabyte,
`G' for gigabyte,
`T' for terabyte,
`P' for petabyte,
and `E' for exabyte.
.TP
.B \-i
Print i-node statistics.
.TP
.BI \-M \ mtab
Use the specified
.I mtab
file to get a list of mounted filesystems.
.SH FILES
.TP
.B /etc/mtab
default mount table
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.TP
.B SYSV3
If this variable is set,
the output text `files' is changed to `i-nodes'.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
find(1),
statvfs(2),
mtab(5),
mount(8)
.SH NOTES
.PP
This
.I df
implementation cannot handle unmounted file systems.
.PP
Some advanced file system designs allocate i-nodes dynamically.
.I Df
then tries to estimate free and total counts of available files.
This is currently done for the
.I reiserfs
file system.
