/*
* Structure of a collation file:
*  1. CollHead (maintbl is 0 if CHF_ENCODED)
*   if !CHF_ENCODED then
*    2. CollElem[bytes] (256 for 8 bit bytes)
*    3. if CHF_INDEXED then
*	 CollElem[wides] (nmain-256 for 8 bit bytes)
*	else
*	 CollMult[wides]
*    4. CollMult[*] (none if multtbl is 0)
*    5. wuchar_type[*] (none if repltbl is 0)
*    6. CollSubn[*] (none if subntbl is 0)
*    7. strings (first is pathname for .so if CHF_DYNAMIC)
*
* The actual location of parts 2 through 7 is not important.
*
* The main table is in encoded value order.
*
* All indeces/offsets must be nonzero to be effective; zero is reserved
* to indicate no-such-entry.  This implies either that an unused initial
* entry is placed in each of (4) through (7), or that the "start offset"
* given by the header is artificially pushed back by an entry size.
*
* Note that if CHF_ENCODED is not set, then nweight must be positive.
*
* If an element can begin a multiple character element, it contains a
* nonzero multbeg which is the initial index into (4) for its list;
* the list is terminated by a CollMult with a ch of zero.
*
* If there are elements with the same primary weight (weight[1]), then
* for each such element, it must have a CollMult list.  The CollMult
* that terminates the list (ch==0) notes the lowest and highest basic
* weights for those elements with that same primary weight value
* respectively in weight[0] and weight[1].  If there are some basic
* weights between these values that do not have the same primary
* weight--are not in the equivalence class--then the terminator also
* has a SUBN_SPECIAL mark.  Note that this list terminator should be
* shared when the elements are not multiple character collating
* elements because they wouldn't otherwise have a CollMult list.
*
* WGHT_IGNORE is used to denote ignored collating elements for a
* particular collation ordering pass.  All main table entries other
* than for '\0' will have a non-WGHT_IGNORE weight[0].  However, it is
* possible for a CollMult entries from (4) to have a WGHT_IGNORE
* weight[0]:  If, for example, "xyz" is a multiple character collating
* element, but "xy" is not, then the CollMult for "y" will have a
* WGHT_IGNORE weight[0].  Also, WGHT_IGNORE is used to terminate each
* list of replacement weights.
*
* Within (3), it is possible to describe a sequence of unremarkable
* collating elements with a single CollMult entry.  If the SUBN_SPECIAL
* bit is set, the rest of subnbeg represents the number of collating
* elements covered by this entry.  The weight[0] values are determined
* by adding the difference between the encoded value and the entry's ch
* value to the entry's weight[0].  This value is then substituted for
* any weight[n], n>0 that has only the WGHT_SPECIAL bit set. libuxre_collelem()
* hides any match to such an entry by filling in a "spare" CollElem.
*
* If there are substitution strings, then for each character that begins
* a string, it has a nonzero subnbeg which is similarly the initial
* index into (6).  The indeces in (6) refer to offsets within (7).
