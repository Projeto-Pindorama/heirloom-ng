.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B nl
command
prints a
.IR file ,
or, when no
.I file
argument is given,
standard input,
preceding lines with line numbers on the left.
.PP
Lines with special content are taken as page delimiters.
Three parts of pages are distinguished:
header, body and footer.
Each part is started when a line consisting only of the
following characters appears in input:
.RS
.sp
.TS
l l
lfB l.
Line contents	Start of
\e:\e:\e:	header
\e:\e:	body
\e:	footer
.TE
.sp
.RE
Line numbers are reset each time a header begins.
The start of the file is considered a body part
until a line marking another part appears.
.PP
The following options alter the behavior of
.BR nl :
.TP
.BI \-b type
Specifies which lines in a body part are numbered, where
.I type
is one of the following:
.RS
.TP
.B a
Number all lines,
unless otherwise specified by the
.B \-l
option.
.TP
.B t
Number all non-empty lines.
.TP
.B n
Number no lines.
.TP
.BI p string
Number all lines that match the regular expression
.IR string .
Regular expressions are as in
.IR ed (1);
.B /usr/5bin/nl
uses simple regular expressions,
.BR /usr/5bin/posix/nl ,
.BR /usr/5bin/posix2001/nl ,
and
.B /usr/5bin/s42/nl
use basic regular expressions.
.RE
.IP
The default is
.BR t .
.TP
.BI \-d delim
Change the special characters that delimit parts of a page
to the two characters in
.IR delim .
If
.I delim
consists of only one character,
the second character remains the default, `\fB:\fR'.
.TP
.BI \-f type
Specifies which lines in a footer part are numbered,
where
.I type
has the format described for
.BR \-b .
The default is
.BR n .
.TP
.BI \-h type
Specifies which lines in a header part are numbered,
where
.I type
has the format described for
.BR \-b .
The default is
.BR n .
.TP
.BI \-i incr
Line numbers are increased by
.IR incr ,
which defaults to 1.
.TP
.BI \-l num
For the
.BR \-ba ,
.BR \-fa ,
and
.B \-ha
options,
specifies which line of adjacent blank lines is printed.
The default is 1 (print all blank lines).
.TP
.BI \-n format
Sets the format of line numbers, where
.I format
is one of:
.RS
.TP
.B ln
left-justified, preceded by blanks
.TP
.B rn
right-justified, preceded by blanks
.TP
.B rz
right-justified, preceded by zeros
.RE
.IP
The default is
.BR rn .
.TP
.B \-p
Line numbers are not reset at the start of each header
when this option is present.
.TP
.BI \-s sep
Sets the string that separates line number and line content in output,
default is a tabulator.
.TP
.BI \-v start#
Each page is numbered starting at
.IR start# ,
which defaults to 1.
.TP
.BI \-w width
Sets the width of line numbers.
If a number has fewer digits than
.IR width ,
it is padded as described for the
.B \-n
option;
if it has more digits,
only the last
.I width
digits are printed.
The default
.I width
is 6.
.PP
The
.I file
argument can appear between options.
For
.B /usr/5bin/nl
and
.BR /usr/5bin/s42/nl ,
option and option argument must not be separated;
if an option is not immediately followed by its argument,
the default value is used.
.B /usr/5bin/posix/nl
and
.B /usr/5bin/posix2001/nl
require an option argument
and accept it regardless of space between option and argument.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.TP
.BR LANG ", " LC_ALL
See
.IR locale (7).
.TP
.B LC_COLLATE
Affects the collation order for range expressions,
equivalence classes, and collation symbols in basic
regular expressions.
.TP
.B LC_CTYPE
Determines the mapping of bytes to characters.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
To number all lines in a file,
effectively disabling header and footer recognition
since no line can contain a second newline character
and thus the condition is never met:
.RS
.sp
.nf
nl \-ba \-d\'
\&\' file
.fi
.sp
.RE
Note that there is no white space
other than the newline character
between \' \'.
.PP
To number all lines that are not empty
and contain at least one non-blank character:
.RS
.sp
.nf
nl \-bp\'[^      ]\' file
.fi
.sp
.RE
The characters between [ ] are:
.\" -- not really, don't mess up troff --
a circumflex, a space, and a tabulator.

.SH NOTES
Since the default width causes line numbers
to be truncated if they consist of more than six digits, the
.B \-w
option should be used to increase this value
if higher numbers are to be expected.
